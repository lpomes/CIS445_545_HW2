<h3>Background about me</h3>
Hi my name is Luke Pomes. I am currently a junior at Bradley University studying computer information systems and management information systems.

I started programming back in high school and have been interested ever since. The more I learn about these concepts the more fascinated I am about how far programming/technology has gotten. This makes me want to continue to learn while also enjoying it.
<br><br>
-💼 I'm currently working on finding an internship<br>
-📚 Currently learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript<br>
-🎉 Goal for 2024: Survive the semester<br>
-📺 Favorite show is Breaking Bad<br>
-🎵 Favorite artist is Daft Punk<br>
-🐻⬇ Fun fact: I'm a huge Chicago Bears fan


<h3>🎓Long term goals</h3>
For my long term goals it's hard to say. I like setting short term goals so I can gradually move towards a long term goal. Right now my main goal is to learn as much as possible these next two years to expand my knowledge to be capable of using these skills in future jobs or wherever I'm at when I graduate.
<br>

<h3>💻Languages/Appications learned</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Languages: <b>Java, C++, SQL</b></li>
    <li>Microsoft applications: <b>Word, PowerPoint, Excel, Access</b></li>
    <li>systems: <b>Windows 10</b></li>
</ul>


<h3>📁Experience</h3>
So far I have not had much work experience but I've had many different roles for clubs and volunteer work. I am currently the treasurer for my fraternity. I create the budget using an excel spreadsheet and calculate financials using a website called OmegaFi. For volunteer work, I usually go to Loaves and Fish as a helper for those in need of food and living supplies.
