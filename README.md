## Hi, I'm Luke Pomes 👋

### Background about me
<p>Hi my name is Luke Pomes. I am currently a junior at Bradley University studying computer information systems and management information systems.</p>

<p>I started programming back in high school and have been interested ever since. The more I learn about these concepts the more fascinated I am about how far programming/technology has gotten. This makes me want to continue to learn while also enjoying it.</p>

<p>I'm currently learning how to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Before this year I had no prior knowledge or experience using these. I'm hoping to expand my knowlege with all three by the end of the year.</p>

Fun fact: I'm a big football fan of the Chicago Bears. Being a Bears fan has its rough times but I'm here for the long run 🐻⬇
