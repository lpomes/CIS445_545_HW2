### <b>🎓Long term goals</b>
For my long term goals it's hard to say. I like setting short term goals so I can gradually move towards a long term goal. Right now my main goal is to learn as much as possible these next two years to expand my knowledge to be capable of using these skills in future jobs or wherever I'm at when I graduate.
