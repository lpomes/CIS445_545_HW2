<h3>🎓Long term goals</h3>
For my long term goals it's hard to say. I like setting short term goals so I can gradually move towards a long term goal. Right now my main goal is to learn as much as possible these next two years to expand my knowledge to be capable of using these skills in future jobs or wherever I'm at when I graduate.

<h3>📁Experience</h3>
So far I have not had much work experience but I've had many different roles for clubs and volunteer work. I am currently the treasurer for my fraternity. I create the budget using an excel spreadsheet and calculate financials using a website called OmegaFi. For volunteer work, I usually go to Loaves and Fish as a helper for those in need of food and living supplies.
