## Hi, I'm Luke Pomes üëã

### Background about me
Hi my name is Luke Pomes. I am currently a junior at Bradley University studying computer information systems and management information systems.

I started programming back in high school and have been interested ever since. The more I learn about these concepts the more fascinated I am about how far programming/technology has gotten. This makes me want to continue to learn while also enjoying it.

I'm currently learning how to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Before this year I had no prior knowledge or experience using these. I'm hoping to expand my knowlege with all three by the end of the year.

Fun fact: I'm a big football fan of the Chicago Bears. Being a Bears fan has its rough times but I'm here for the long run üêª‚¨á
