## Hi, I'm Luke Pomes 👋

### Background about me
Hi my name is Luke Pomes. I am currently a junior at Bradley University studying computer information systems and management information systems.

I started programming back in high school and have been interested ever since. The more I learn about these concepts the more fascinated I am about how far programming/technology has gotten. This makes me want to continue to learn while also enjoying it.

I'm currently learning how to use HTML and CSS. Before this year I had no prior knowledge or experience using these two. I'm hoping to expand my knowlege with HTML and CSS by the end of the year.

Fun fact: I'm a big football fan of the Chicago Bears. Being a Bears fan has its rough times but I'm here for the long run 🐻⬇
